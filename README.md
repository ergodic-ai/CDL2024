# CDL2024

Welcome to the CDL2024 repository, prepared by Andre Franca and Amy Hodler! Here you'll find all materials for our talk: **CDL 2024 Causal Graphs in Action: Navigating the Arrow of Why**

## Structure

The repository is organized into tutorials and examples that demonstrate various aspects of causal inference and discovery:

### Tutorials

1. Conditional Independence - Learn about the fundamental concept of conditional independence and its role in causal analysis
2. Confounders and Colliders - Understand how confounding and colliding variables affect causal relationships
3. Causal Discovery - Explore methods for discovering causal structures from observational data

### Examples

1. Diabetes Dataset - Analyzing causal relationships in diabetes data using various techniques
2. San Francisco Traffic Accidents - Investigating causal factors in traffic accidents
3. AdSmart AB Testing - Real-world example of causal inference in A/B testing

## Datasets

The repository includes several datasets for practical exercises and examples:

- Diabetes dataset (from sklearn)
- San Francisco Traffic Accidents (`data/SF_Traffic.csv`)
- AdSmart AB Testing data (`AdSmartABdata.csv`)
